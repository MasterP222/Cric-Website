            <p class="description-text">
               I started this Bootcamp to teach cricket in a fun way. At first, it was hard to get people to come. Parents don't want someone inexperienced teaching their children. I had to spend a lot of time marketing: showing my highlights and convincing them I deserve to teach. On the first day, I had only 2 students, and I did my best to teach them the basics. They liked it and they invited their friends. I soon had 6 students, and although it was tough, I did my best to make it enjoyable and also be informative. Those 3 weeks were fun, not just for the students but for me too. And seeing them smile and be happy was the best feeling in the world.

We decided to let him try wicket keeping since that doesnt require bowling. He excelled at wicketkeepign due to his prior experience as a goal keeper in soccer. </h3>

                <p class="about-text">
                    With over 15 years of experience in cricket coaching and player development, 
                    I am passionate about nurturing the next generation of cricket talent. 
                    As a former professional player and certified Level 3 coach, I bring 
                    both technical expertise and real-world experience to every training session. 
                    My coaching philosophy centers on building not just skilled players, 
                    but confident individuals who embody the spirit of cricket both on and off the field.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    I have had the privilege of coaching players at various levels, from grassroots 
                    youth programs to competitive club cricket. My approach combines traditional 
                    cricket fundamentals with modern training techniques, ensuring each player 
                    develops a strong foundation while adapting to the evolving nature of the game.
