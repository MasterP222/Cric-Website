            <p class="description-text">
               I started this Bootcamp to teach cricket in a fun way. At first, it was hard to get people to come. Parents don't want someone inexperienced teaching their children. I had to spend a lot of time marketing: showing my highlights and convincing them I deserve to teach. On the first day, I had only 2 students, and I did my best to teach them the basics. They liked it and they invited their friends. I soon had 6 students, and although it was tough, I did my best to make it enjoyable and also be informative. Those 3 weeks were fun, not just for the students but for me too. And seeing them smile and be happy was the best feeling in the world.

                    <h3>"Bowling because I need to keep my arm straight" - Shreesta. Shreesta was a good student, but he had trouble keeping his arm straight while bowling. We decided to let him try wicket-keeping since that doesn't require bowling. He excelled at wicketkeeping due to his prior experience as a goalkeeper in soccer. </h3>

While everyone else was there with their friends, Bhrami didn't know anyone. Still, Bhrami came every day and practiced as hard as anyone. She would always ask questions and always improve. In the end, she made new friends, and that is why Cricket Bootcamp is a success since it fostered connections and made cricket fun. </h3>

He only came because he was friends with Ishaan and Siddarth. Still, he was a great student who tried to learn as much as possible. When we started the practice games, Siddarth wanted more people to come since cricket is played with 22 people. But even though we only had 10, he still played his heart out and had fun.</h3>

He was a great bowler and learned batting very quickly. It also made the class boring for him sometimes. He is one of the main reasons we started playing practice games. Since it allowed him to practice in a competitive environment and I could teach the rest of the students.</h3>

                <p class="about-text">
                   My name is Parnav Varshney. I am a senior at Cupertino High School. 
                    I used to play competitive cricket, but I quickly realised it wasn't for me. 
                    I want to become a Corporate Lawyer, but mostly I just want to be happy. 
                    I started The Cricket Bootcamp as a way to teach in a fun way. I wanted kids to like learning. 
                    I wanted them to want to come back. But it wasn't easy. 
                    Reserving a ground was har,d and convincing parents that I deserved to teach their children was very hard. 
                    I spent hours going door to door trying to get anyone to listen, I posted on every social media site, and made sure to tell any adult I knew.
